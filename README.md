Python Chat Application (Server & Client)

Welcome! This project is a simple chat application built in Python, allowing a server and client to communicate over the same system (localhost). This can be easily extended to work over a network by modifying the host IP.

Features:-
Real-time messaging between a client and server.
Automatic reconnection if the connection is lost.
Simple, multi-threaded design to allow sending and receiving messages simultaneously.
Error handling to manage connection issues gracefully.

How It Works
Server: Starts by waiting for a client to connect. Once connected, the server can send and receive messages from the client.

Client: Attempts to connect to the server. Once connected, the client can send and receive messages from the server.
Reconnection: If either the client or server disconnects unexpectedly, they will automatically try to reconnect every 5 seconds.

How to Run
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Steps:
Download the code: Clone this repository or download the .py files.

Run the Server:

Open a terminal window and run the server code:
bash
Copy code
python server.py
The server will start and wait for a client connection.
Run the Client:

Open a new terminal window and run the client code:
bash
Copy code
python client.py
The client will attempt to connect to the server.
Start Chatting:

Once the client and server are connected, you can start sending messages back and forth!
The server and client will prompt you for input (You (Server) and You (Client) respectively).
Example Usage
bash
Copy code
# In one terminal window (for the server):
python server.py

# In another terminal window (for the client):
python client.py
Server Output Example:

arduino
Copy code
Server is running and waiting for a connection...
Client ('127.0.0.1', 56789) connected!
Client: Hello from the Client!
You (Server): Hi Client!
Client Output Example:

arduino or rasperberry pi 
Copy code
Connected to the server!
Server: Hi Client!
You (Client): Hello from the Client!
Reconnection Handling
If the connection is dropped, both the server and client will automatically attempt to reconnect every 5 seconds.
Youâ€™ll see messages indicating connection errors and successful reconnections.
Customizing the Code

Host: By default, both server and client use localhost (127.0.0.1). If you want to run this over a network, change host='localhost' to the IP address of the machine running the server.

Port: The default port is 1234. You can change the port by modifying the port parameter when initializing the server and client.
Known Limitations
The server can handle only one client at a time. It will wait for a client to reconnect if disconnected, but doesn't support multiple simultaneous clients.

The system is designed for basic text messaging, but it can be extended for more complex functionalities (e.g., file transfer, encryption, etc.).


Future Improvements
Support for multiple clients using threads or asynchronous networking.
Add encryption for secure communication.
Extend to work on external networks, not just localhost.

Troubleshooting
Connection issues: If the client cannot connect to the server, make sure both are running on the same machine and using the same port and host.
Crashes: The program is designed to handle common network errors, but if something unexpected happens, check the error messages for clues.
